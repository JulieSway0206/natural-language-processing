The wordlist.py is code of the 5 question of Brown clustering.
After running this script, you will get a list of tuples, each of which contains a word and its frequency
number in brown corpus. This list of tuples was printed in the vocabulary.txt.
In addition, i also made the original text to a list of list of words, in which each list of words is a line in the text.
And i also made a dictionary, in which the key is a word in vacabulary, and the value is another dictionary, in which the
key is the word that is ajacent to the key word in the text, and the value is the frequency number. I used pickle to save
these three things and load them in the code for next question - brown_cluster.py.

In brown_cluster.py, i used the method in percy liang's paper. But my code has problem - the 'UNK' cluster keeps swallowing
other clusters, i cannot figure this out, i wish you coud tell me why this may happen if you are able to find the problem.
Thanks!
